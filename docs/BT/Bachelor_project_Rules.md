### STRUCTURE OF THE BACHELOR THESIS (BT)

Main parts of the BT are in following text bold and highlighted

There is no one uniquely acceptable format for a Bachelor thesis. The format you adopt will
depend on your topic, your approach to it and opinion of the Dept. where you shall defend it.
For reference see also:
Dean’s directive for diploma thesis and the comprehensive final examination in Bachelor’s and Master’s
programs at the FEE at CTU

A conventional format, to which all Bachelor theses should conform contains following sections:

Topic registration form (Bachelor’s thesis assignment): Since the original undamaged form will be a
part of your Bachelor thesis, you shall prepare a working copy of it and use it during the
semester.
The form contains approximately four parts of the assignment. These parts must be
covered in your Bachelor thesis. In case you are not able to fully cover these parts it is
necessary to explain it and give reasons for it because the reviewer will assess the
fulfilment of the assignment.

Declaration:

“I hereby declare that this master’s thesis is the product of my own independent work and that I have
clearly stated all information sources used in the thesis according to Methodological Instruction No.
1/2009 – “On maintaining ethical principles when working on a university final project, CTU in
Prague“.

Date Signature“

Abstract: English, (Czech/Slovak)

Contents: including numbers of pages and list of appendices

List of acronyms and abbreviations: abbreviation – (text in foreign language when applicable) – text
in English

Introduction: introduction of the topic, presentation of the goal of the paper

Body of the paper: a) introduction into the research field (research of the information resources);
it must be clear: - what you have read

- difference between rewriting of other people’s thoughts
    (paraphrasing, summarizing) and quotations. Both require
    referencing (stating of the resource)
- what is your own contribution (if there is any in this part)
b) implementation based on the introductory part (description of the solution in
accordance with the Topic registration form)
Conclusion: presenting the research problem, main results, conclusion, assessment of the results and
clearly stated contribution of the author of the BT and how the requirements from the
Topic registration form have been fulfilled


Bibliography and references: it is absolutely impossible to use Wikipedia and other unreliable
resources as a reference in your BT!

Appendices: when necessary

A usual bachelor thesis shall contain 20-50 double-sided A4 pages + appendices, text size 11, thermal
binding (not spiral binding!).

In the following semester you will continue the work on your BT individually.

For submitting BT students shall upload the complete BT as a .pdf file in KOS according to the
Academic calendar available on the web page of FEE CTU.

Then, again in the term given in the Academic calendar, they must upload the complete DT as a .pdf file
in KOS. The uploaded version of BT shall contain NO SIGNATURES (i.e. also the signatures from
the Topic registration form must be erased in this version of BT)!

Be aware that of the fact the BT (in the form uploaded) will be downloaded by the opponent of your BT
and will be publicly available online.

It is necessary to register/enroll for the Defense of the BT in KOS.
