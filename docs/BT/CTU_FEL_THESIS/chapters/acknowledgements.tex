\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof.~Ing.~Miroslav Hus{\'a}k, CSc., for the initial discussions that helped shape the topic and scope of this thesis, as well as for his valuable high-level guidance.

I would also like to acknowledge the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and the Czech Technical University as a whole for providing an academic environment in which I was able to develop not only foundational theoretical knowledge and practical skills, but also the ability to think independently, adapt, and grow---competencies essential for future professional development and for functioning in society.

Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family for their patience, encouragement, and rock-solid support throughout my studies and my life. Their support has been a constant source of strength and motivation, without which this work would not have been possible.
