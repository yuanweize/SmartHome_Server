  # ----------------------------
  # mTLS certificates (two supported ways)
  # ----------------------------
  # 1) File paths (recommended for docker): relative to this brokers.yml
  #    If using one-way TLS, only ca_file is required.
  ca_file: "./certs/ca/ca.pem"
  cert_file: "./certs/client/client.pem"
  key_file: "./certs/client/client.key"

  # 2) Inline PEM text (recommended for quick local debugging)
  #    If provided, inline PEM takes priority over file paths.
  #    If inline TLS setup fails, it falls back to file paths (if present).
